Rendering a Cylinder Between Two Points in OpenGL
-------------------------------------------------

This problem is more of a pain than one would think!
Here is some code that does it, based on the implementation
which used to be posted at the following URL by Joel J. Parris:
http://home.neo.rr.com/jparris/OpenGL%20-%20draw%20cylinder%20between%202%20pts.htm

I posted this code on my blog in July 2008, and since then it has
apparently got a lot of attention and use! I thought I'd make a
repository for it so others can contribute their suggestions.

The original post can be found here:

and here

This code is in the public domain.
